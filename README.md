# Relationships Homework

### Brief

Create a web app with 2 resources that are linked by a one to many relationship. Have a drop down menu for the genre type and have all crud methods.

### What went well

I managed to set up all the forms easily and the rail commands worked well.

### Difficulties

I had a difficulty creating a new movie as I didn't set the genre_id when I made the controller so I had to set that in the private params manually which took me a while to figure out.

### What I delivered

I delivered on all the details in the brief.
